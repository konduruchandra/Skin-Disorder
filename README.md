# Skin-Disorder

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The Skin Disorder Prediction project aims to classify different types of skin disorders based on patient data. Using machine learning models, the system analyzes medical attributes and predicts the likelihood of specific skin conditions. This can assist dermatologists in faster and more accurate diagnosis.

ðŸ“‚ Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing & Analysis:

Imported dataset and explored its structure.
Handled missing values and outliers.
Encoded categorical features and scaled numerical ones.
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns in the data.

2. Model Development & Training:

Split dataset into training and testing sets.
Trained multiple classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).
Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV.

3. Model Evaluation & Prediction:

Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Selected the best-performing model for prediction.
Saved the model for deployment or further use.
